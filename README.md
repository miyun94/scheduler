# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

## Purpose
A daily workday scheduler where the user can input their daily tasks and save them in each time slot. Even after the page refreshes, the tasks should still be saved in until deleted by the user. Depending on the time, each time bracket has a different color corresponding to whether the time is in the past, in the future, or present time. This allows the user to have a visual representation for the tasks in relation to the time. 

## Built With
HTML, BOOSTRAP, CSS, JAVASCRIPT
